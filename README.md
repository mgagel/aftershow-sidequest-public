# Private Game Project - Aftershow Sidequest

This group project started out as a mandatory task for the course "Games Programming" at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences. After finishing the course, our friend group continued working on the game. The idea behind Aftershow Sidequest is a Metroidvania-like 2D platformer and shooter that utilizes backtracking in an open world. We were able to come up with an interesting plot and implemented some core gameplay mechanics. Unfortunately, the development stopped after the pandemic came to an end and half of the team left. The project is still left to be finished.

The original repository with the code is set to private due to copyright concerns of some of the original developers.

## Technologies
